# `G1!tCh`

## A roguelike 2D-platformer

`G1!tCh` will be a video game that takes aspects from the roguelike and 2D-platformer genres.
This game can be imagined as _Super Mario Bros._ meeting _Realm of the Mad God_.
`G1!tCh` begins with the main character being teleported into the mythical realm of  *Technolia* in
a *Jumanji*-esque style. The objective for the player is to escape *Technolia* by traversing
through the realm's 5 regions, and defeating any enemies that stand in their way.

Unlike some roguelikes, the level stages of `G1!tCh` will be static and manually generated (not via an algorithm).
At the beginning of the game, the player will have the choice between a hardcore and classic mode.
Hardcode mode will feature a high-risk, high-reward style of gameplay. In this mode, the player will have access to
better weapons and gear, but permanent death will be enabled. Classic mode will be more forgiving and allow the player
to reach checkpoints to save their progress.
